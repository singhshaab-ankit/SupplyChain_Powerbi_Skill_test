PHASE 3 – BEGINNER SCENARIOS

High-Risk Suppliers (Table)

->DAX
1.HighRiskSuppliers =
FILTER (
    Suppliers,
    Suppliers[Risk_Score] > 80
        && Suppliers[Reliability_Rating] < 3
)
->

---

2️ Delayed Shipments (Measure)

->DAX
DelayedShipments =
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER ( Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed" )
)


---

3.Inventory Stock Monitoring (Flag Column – optional)

->DAX
Stock_Below_Threshold =
IF ( Warehouses[Stock_Level] < Warehouses[Min_Threshold], 1, 0 )
->

PHASE 4 – INTERMEDIATE SCENARIOS

4. Most Frequent Return Reasons (implicit count)

Use directly in visual → *Values = Count of Return_ID* (no explicit DAX needed).

---

5. On-Time vs Delayed Shipments by Region

->DAX
OnTimeShipments =
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER ( Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "On Time" )
)

DelayedShipments =
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER ( Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed" )
)
->

---

6. Supplier Performance Dashboard Metrics

->DAX
AvgSupplierRisk =
AVERAGE ( Suppliers[Risk_Score] )

AvgDelayDays =
AVERAGE ( Shipments[Delay_Days] )

DefectRate =
DIVIDE (
    COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( Orders, Orders[Return_Reason] <> "-" ) ),
    COUNTROWS ( Orders )
)


7.Dynamic KPI Metrics

->DAX
AvgDeliveryTime =
AVERAGE ( Shipments[Delay_Days] )

LateShipmentPct =
DIVIDE (
    COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed" ) ),
    COUNTROWS ( Shipments )
)

AvgSupplierRisk =
AVERAGE ( Suppliers[Risk_Score] )
8. Demand Forecasting (for line chart)

No custom DAX required — use existing column
`Warehouses[Demand_Forecast]`
and enable Analytics Pane → Forecast → +Add → Forecast Next 3 Months.

 🚀 PHASE 5 – ADVANCED SCENARIO

9.Composite Supply Chain Risk Model

->DAX
CompositeRisk =
( 0.4 *
    AVERAGE ( Suppliers[Risk_Score] )
)
+ ( 0.3 *
    AVERAGE ( Shipments[Delay_Flag] )
)
+ ( 0.2 *
    AVERAGE ( Orders[Delivery_Flag] )
)
+ ( 0.1 *
    AVERAGEX (
        Warehouses,
        IF ( Warehouses[Stock_Level] < Warehouses[Min_Threshold], 1, 0 )
    )
)
->

Additional Helper Columns

 Delay Flag (for Shipments table)

->DAX
Delay_Flag =
IF ( Shipments[Status] = "Delayed", 1, 0 )
->

 Delivery Flag (for Orders table)

->DAX
Delivery_Flag =
IF ( Orders[Delivery_Status] = "Delayed", 1, 0 )
->

--------------------------------
PHASE 6: DEBUGGING CHALLENGES
1. Incorrect DAX Formula
Given:
LateShipmentPct = COUNTROWS(Shipments[Status] = "Delayed") / COUNTROWS(Shipments)

Incorrect — because COUNTROWS() only takes a table, not a condition.
-> Correct version:
LateShipmentPct = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed")),
    COUNTROWS(Shipments)
)
________________________________________
2. Incorrect Relationship
Orders ↔ Shipments via Warehouse_ID is wrong.
-> Should be linked by Order_ID, because one order can have one or more shipments.
